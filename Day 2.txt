The Window Object:

The Window object is a global object in the browser's JavaScript environment
It represents the browser window or tab and serves as the entry point for interacting with the browser.
Almost everything in a browser's environment is a property of the Window object, making it a powerful entity.


Browser Interaction: 

               The Window object facilitates actions such as opening new browser windows, navigating to different URLs, and controlling the appearance of the browser.


              window.open("https://www.example.com");



The Document Object:

The Document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window. 
 It is a property of the Window object, and through it, developers can access and manipulate the content of a web page dynamically.

Event Handling: 
       
              The Document object allows developers to attach event listeners to HTML elements, enabling the execution of JavaScript code in response to user actions.


                         // Add a click event listener to a button
                         var myButton = document.getElementById("myButton");
                           myButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
                            alert("Button clicked!");
                         });
      While the Window and Document objects are distinct entities, they work in tandem to create dynamic web pages. 
The Window object provides the environment and controls the overall behavior of the browser, while the Document object allows developers to manipulate the content within that environment.
